# Softnet Endpoint Library (Java)

This is the Java source code for Softnet Endpoint Library (Java). It is written in Java SE 1.7 and runs on Linux, Raspbian, Android 5.0 and later versions. "[Softnet Programming Model in Java](https://github.com/Softnet-Free/softnet-java)" explains how to use the library in the embedded Java application development. The library has a dependency on [Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)](https://github.com/softnet-free/asn1codec-java). The executable jar files of both libraries can be dowloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/Softnet-Free/softnet-java/releases) page. However, it is recommended to use executables generated on the target platform instead, because, as practice shows, a jar file created on one platform may not work on another one. 

Softnet Endpoint Library (Java) utilizes data types and packages from Java SE 1.7. If your application is assumed to use the Java 1.7 or Java 1.8 runtime, you can also target this library to that runtime. In this case, to compile this library you need to comment out the code in 'src/module-info.java'. Otherwise, starting with Java 1.9, Java applications use Java Platform Module System (JMPS), and this code is required to declare module-related information and dependencies.
