## 5. Naming convention

Softnet defines a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for text identifiers and names. The minimum and maximum name length limits are 1 and 256 characters unless otherwise noted. The rest of the naming rules are as follows:
- Allowed characters: <span class="text-blue">a-z A-Z 0-9 space _ - . @ # $ % & * ' : ^ / ! ( ) [ ]</span>
- The leading character: <span class="text-blue">a-z A-Z</span>
- The trailing space is not allowed
- Two or more consecutive spaces are not allowed
