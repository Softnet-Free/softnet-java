## 4. The library packages

Softnet Java Library contains 5 packages for use in applications. Three of them, <span class="datatype">softnet</span>, <span class="datatype">softnet.exceptions</span>, and <span class="datatype">softnet.asn</span>, contain the interfaces, classes, and enumerations required for both service and client applications. Service applications also require the <span class="datatype">softnet.service</span> package. And client applications require the <span class="datatype">softnet.client</span> package.
