# Softnet Programming Model (Java)
{: .fs-7 }

by Robert Koifman  

## 1. Abstract

This document guides you through the process of developing IoT applications using Softnet (Java). It explains how to use Softnet in developing client/server communication scenarios as well as event-driven M2M scenarios. The platform makes the TCP and UDP protocols available for use in dynamic IP environments. In addition, Softnet offers Remote Procedure Calls and Application Events as inter-process communication mechanisms, along with Access Control and Service Status Detection mechanisms. You can also use [Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)](https://github.com/softnet-free/asn1codec-java){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to compactly represent complex hierarchical data for transmission over a network.  

Softnet Free is a comprehensive solution for managing IoT projects, services, clients, users, permissions, and contacts. The platform supports shared access to devices with other persons/organizations, allowing owners to establish user-to-user or business-to-consumer relationships. Using Softnet, you can concentrate on the application’s logic without concerning about networking issues.  

To have a complete understanding of Softnet, you may need to learn two more documents: [The Developer Guide to Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)](https://softnet-free.github.io/asn1codec-java){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and «The User Guide to Softnet Management System».
