# Softnet Programming Model in Java
{: .fs-7 }

by Robert Koifman  

## Abstract

This document guides you through the process of developing IoT applications using Softnet Endpoint Library (Java). It explains how to use Softnet in developing client/server communication scenarios as well as event-driven M2M scenarios. The platform makes the TCP and UDP protocols available for use in dynamic IP environments. Softnet offers Remote Procedure Calls and Pub/Sub Events as additional remote IPC mechanisms. The Softnet mechanism of Access Control can be used to implement different levels of access to devices, and a mechanism called Service Status Detection provides clients with information about the connectivity status of remote devices. Using Softnet, you can concentrate on the applicationâ€™s logic without concerning about networking issues. 

Softnet Endpoint Library (Java) has a dependancy from [Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)](https://github.com/softnet-free/asn1codec-java){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The platform uses it to encode/decode messages in the ASN.1 DER format for transmission over a network. You can also use this tool to compactly represent complex hierarchical data for transmission over a network, although you can use any other format, such as JSON. [The Developer Guide to Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)](https://softnet-free.github.io/asn1codec-java){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} explains how to use this codec in the application development.  

Softnet Free offers a comprehensive solution for managing IoT projects, services, clients, users, permissions, and contacts. The platform supports shared access to devices with other persons/organizations, allowing owners to establish user-to-user or business-to-consumer relationships. Designed for both users and developers, [The User Guide to Softnet Management System](https://softnet-free.github.io/softnet-ms){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} contains a detailed explanation of this solution.  

The executable jar files of the "Softnet Endpoint Library (Java)" and "Softnet ASN.1 Codec (Java)" libraries can be dowloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/Softnet-Free/softnet-java/releases) page. However, it is recommended to use executables generated on the target platform instead, because, as practice shows, a jar file created on one platform may not work on another one.
